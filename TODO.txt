Add `notorious publish file_name project_name`, which publishes notes to a
  server (e.g. notorious.com/public/x)
  by posting to notorious.com/new with content == the markdown
  The MD is converted to html and stored in a DB under the appropriate keyname,
  to be served on request. Then, notorious gets a 200 with the url, and says
  THANKS! your site is now hosted at notorious.com/public/project_name
  Make sure to lower case and remove spaces for the url / db record, but save
  them for the title, which will appear in the title bar
